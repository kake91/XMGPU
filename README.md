# XMGPU
this oneclik Miner was inspired by JozefJarosciak /xgpu
# To Mine XENBLOCK, Rent a GPU on vast and copy paste the following command 
curl -o ~/XNMMiner.sh -LJO https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kake91/XMGPU/master/XNMMiner.sh  && sudo chmod +x XNMMiner.sh && sudo ./XNMMiner.sh

# Execution for 10 GPU Max
The script will install all the necessary tools and clone the XENGPUMiner from the repository 'shanhaicoder/XENGPUMiner.' 
You will be prompted to enter your wallet address and press enter
After that you will be prompted to enter the number of GPU you wanna use and press enter
After that, give it some time to run everything with number of GPU selected. Anyone is welcome to use and try it, but there is still some optimization to be done
